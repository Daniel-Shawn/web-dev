-------HELLO!-----
  
  ABOUT ME:)
    My name is Daniel. Im an aspiring web developer. Started learning web dev just this yr, 2022 at around Sep when I differed from Uni due to fees. So far Ive covered HTML, CSS and a little bit of JS....just a little. I went through the JS course video by Freecodecamp on YT and another by Super simple Dev.

Hope I get there


This is just a dummy photographer portfolio I made using 
CSS and a little JS
